# About Me
Hey, I am a 2A double degree student at the University of Waterloo pursuing Computer Science and Business Administration. I have experience in full stack and software development, having done my previous internships at the Royal Bank of Canada and Danima Creative Group. When I am not coding, I love travelling. Some places I visited include: Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, USA, and India. I am currently searching for Winter 2021 internships for Software Engineering or Data. Feel free to reach out to me at d52shah@uwaterloo.ca ðŸ˜„


# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- Making a C++ interpreted programming language, called Cumin.
- Creating an online IDE for the Cumin language in React.
- Integrating Valorant game data on my discord bot <a href = "http://www.gromp.xyz/">GROMP</a> for analyzing, creating, and sharing player statistics.
- Full stack developer for Golden Hack, Canada's first business and entrepreneurship hackathon.
- Using Node.js and Firebase to create an applicant dashboard for echoAR and ToHacks.
